# Oil Price Forecasting using Prophet and ARIMA

This project demonstrates the process of predicting future oil prices using time series forecasting models, including **Prophet** and **ARIMA**. The project involves conducting an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on historical oil price data, followed by building and evaluating the performance of two different forecasting models: **Prophet** and **ARIMA**.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to predict the future price of oil using historical data. The steps include:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: 
   - Analyzing the oil price dataset to understand its structure, trends, and seasonality.
   - Visualizing the time series data and checking for patterns or anomalies.

2. **Time Series Forecasting**:
   - Using **Prophet**: A forecasting tool developed by Facebook, suitable for time series data with strong seasonal effects and missing data.
   - Using **ARIMA**: Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average model, commonly used for time series forecasting when the data shows patterns and trends.

3. **Model Evaluation**: 
   - Comparing the results of both models using performance metrics like RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) and MAE (Mean Absolute Error).
   - Selecting the best-performing model based on accuracy.
